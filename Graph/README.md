# Graph
C++ library for graph data structure.
It includes almost all graph algorithms like dfs,bfs,dijkstra,floydWarshall,minimumSpanningTree,Topological sort,check for cycle,strongly connected components for directed graph
By using abstract base class Graph classes derived classes DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph inherited and implemented

# How to use
1)Directed graph
  I)include "DirectedGraph.h" in your .cpp(source) file.
  II)Declare it using "DirectedGraph instancename(nodes)"   Ex: DirectedGraph newGraph(5)

2)Undirected graph
  I)include "UndirectedGraph.h" in your .cpp(source) file.
  II)Declare it using "UndirectedGraph instancename(nodes)"   Ex: UndirectedGraph newGraph(5)

# Options
1)Create empty graph with n vertices
2)Add an unweighted/weighted edge between two nodes.
3)Graph traversal algorithms(DFS and BFS).
4)Shorest path algorithms(dijkstra and floydWarshall).
5)Cost of minimumSpanningTree
6)Topological Sort
7)Check for the cycle
8)Strongly connected components in a Directed Graph.
